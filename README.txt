The website is just a simple demonstration of how a chat system works. It does not have much error handling yet so make sure you input the correct details when loging in.


How to load the project.
-----------------------------------------
1. copy the general folder "webchat" to htdocs and launch browser then use the link localhost/webchat
2. create a db named "mydatabase" then use the scripts in the dbscripts.sql file to create tables
3. Open another browser simultaneously and again open localhost/webchat
4. Now you have two of the same website running on different browsers( this is to emulate different devices)
5. Create an account for each browser's website then log in and try sending and receiving messages from one website to the other.
6. Refresh on the other website everytime to see the message sent by the other browser
